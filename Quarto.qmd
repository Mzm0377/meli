![As a future scientist, I know I'll face many challenges;thus, I decided to take this class to broaden my horizon and be able to manage those challenges in future.](images/clipboard-1555617983.png) First, describe what you consider to be one of the most ground-breaking or "disruptive" papers in your field. Next, describe the most ground-breaking or disruptive paper in your field in the past 5-10 years. Do you believe the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in your field has declined in recent years? Why or why not?

In my point of view “Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid” by James Watson and Francis Crick, published in Nature in 1953 is one the most disruptive papers in biomedical science. The discovery of DNA's double helix structure, which drastically altered our knowledge of genetics, inheritance, and the molecular processes underpinning life itself, made this work groundbreaking. This discovery made modern molecular biology and biotechnology possible, opening the door to innovations in genetic engineering, DNA sequencing, and customized medicine. it had a significant impact on science and is frequently cited as one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the 20th century. The publication “A Programmable Dual-RNA-Guided DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity” by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna is one of the most groundbreaking papers in biomedical science in the past 5-10 years. In this paper, they introduced the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the first time which is an amazing tool for genome editing. CRISPR-Cas9 is an easy and cheap method to target special genes. In addition, it has been used across different fields. For instance, in disease research, it can model genetic disorders in animals and humans; also, in agriculture, they use it to produce more resilient crops. Furthermore, it accelerates research projects, so, the experiments that took a long time to be done can be done in a few months instead.

I believe that the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in biomedical science has declined in recent years due to the following reasons: 1- Nowadays, fields like genomic and synthetic biology are growing more complex, so, paradigm-shifting discoveries need interdisciplinary cooperation and cutting-edge tools. These tools are distributed among research labs widely. 2- Much of what has been discovered recently is based on fundamental discoveries made in previous decades, like the structure of DNA and the creation of CRISPR. Gradual improvements in current technologies frequently lead to dramatic advances as science becomes more complicated. For instance, whereas CRISPR had a significant early impact, more recent developments—like base editing and prime editing—are building upon and improving upon that ground-breaking discovery. 3- Basic science used to have a lot of breakthroughs (e.g., Watson and Crick's DNA structure). More paradigm-shifting work is now being done in applied science and translational medicine, where studies are directly influencing clinical therapies like COVID-19 vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and big data and AI-driven customized medicine. Although the real-world impact of these innovations is enormous, they may not feel as profoundly disruptive as the discovery of DNA's structure. 4- The pursuit and use of disruptive research are also influenced by social and ethical considerations. Certain technologies, such as CRISPR, are being used more slowly in some areas because they have raised significant ethical questions. This may slow down how quickly and obviously disruptive the insights emerge, without reducing their groundbreaking status.

**Reflect on the role of scientific computing in your discipline, particularly the use of programs, apps, and web-based tools for data analysis, management, data visualization, and communicating complex information to a broader audience. What challenges do you encounter when using these tools? Are there specific computing tools or techniques you currently use or plan to incorporate into your research?**

In my major, which is biomedical science, for managing large-scale data, such as genomic sequences, clinical data, or imaging study findings, programs, apps, and web-based solutions are essential. In the following, each factor will be clarified separately:

1- Data Analysis: In order to find trends, variations, or connections with disease, scientists can analyze large, complicated data sets using tools like R, Python, and specialist software like Bioconductor and MATLAB. Large, diverse datasets are increasingly being used to extract insights using machine learning and statistical models.

2- Data Management: Data must be properly organized, especially regarding sensitive patient information. Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and cloud-based data storage are two examples of platforms that assist researchers in managing massive datasets while adhering to privacy regulations like HIPAA. Maintaining reproducibility in data requires careful annotation, easy accessibility, and secure storage.

3- Data Visualization: Complex biological data communication to larger audiences frequently calls for sophisticated visualization methods. Researchers can construct easily understood graphs with tools like GraphPad Prism, ggplot2 in R, or bespoke Python libraries like Matplotlib. It can be difficult yet essential for discovery to integrate multi-dimensional data (e.g., integrating clinical, molecular, and imaging data) into a single visualization.

4- Communication of complex data: Research findings can be interactively presented using web-based platforms (like Shiny in R) and visualization tools, enabling non-specialists to examine the data. Dashboards, for instance, can make real-time developing clinical trial data accessible to stakeholders and clinicians. Making user-friendly interfaces without oversimplifying scientific material is a challenge.

Here are some examples of the challenges that students in my major might face using these tools:

1- Specialized coding or statistical analysis knowledge is needed to use many bioinformatics tools. For biologists who have little experience with computers, learning R, Python, or even proprietary platforms might be intimidating.

2-Reproducibility: It can be difficult to manage enormous datasets and guarantee transparent, repeatable computational procedures, particularly when varying software versions or algorithms may produce somewhat varied outcomes.

3-Data Integration: Biomedical data is generated from multiple sources (e.g., imaging, genomics, clinical trials), and the technical integration of these different data types is challenging.

Currently, one of the most important tools I am utilizing is GraphPad Prism. It is a very helpful tool for those who do standard statistical tests (such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression). Also, producing suitable graphs for publication is another advantage of it.

One of the other programs I am planning to learn is Python. One of the most important uses of this program is for bioinformatics to sequence analysis and perform genome mapping.

In my point of view, handling conflicting or disagreeable reviewer feedback on a manuscript requires a balance of professionalism, critical thinking, and strategic communication. My initial course of action when I hear feedback I disagree with is to thoroughly study the reviewer's point of view and evaluate their concerns. It's critical to maintain an open mind because reviewers frequently possess insightful knowledge and can point out areas that need improvement. I might have overlooked it. If after thoughtful consideration I still disagree, I make sure my response is respectful and supported by evidence. I clearly explain why I believe my original approach is valid, referencing relevant literature or data where appropriate. This makes it clearer that scientific logic, not taste, is the basis for all of my decisions.

When I receive comments that differ from that of another reviewer, I approach the situation with a similar mindset. Initially, I examine both viewpoints to see if there is a synthesis or compromise that could allay the reviewers' concerns. If the feedback is irreconcilable, I make an informed decision on which feedback aligns better with my research goals and the integrity of the manuscript. I expressly note the inconsistency in my response letter and provide a clear justification for my choice, stating why I chose to heed one proposal over the other. By maintaining transparency and using evidence-based reasoning, I aim to show that I took all feedback seriously, while still defending the rigor and direction of my work.

\*\*Week six: collaborative research & authorship

As one of Dr. Andrews' collaborators, I would approach the situation thoughtfully. While Dr. Andrews developed the original idea and secured funding, authorship should ideally reflect contributions to the research process, such as design, implementation, analysis, and writing. Dr. Andrews’ expectation to be included as an author on every paper associated with the grant is not entirely unreasonable given her pivotal role in the proposal's inception. However, authorship guidelines (e.g., from journals or professional societies) generally emphasize remarkable contributions to the research and writing process. If Dr. Andrews did not contribute actively during the project's implementation, her request may not align with these guidelines.

I would arrange a meeting with Dr. Andrews to discuss authorship expectations openly. Then, I’d start by acknowledging her foundational role in the project, highlighting the importance of her idea in securing funding and shaping the research direction. In addition, I would bring up general authorship guidelines, emphasizing that contributions should reflect involvement in various phases of the project. I might suggest a compromise, such as including her as a co-author on key papers that directly relate to her original hypothesis or where she has provided meaningful input, while being clear that authorship on every paper would require more direct involvement. I’d recommend we establish clear authorship criteria at the beginning of each paper's preparation to ensure everyone has aligned expectations moving forward. By handling the conversation with respect and clarity, I hope to reach a fair understanding that acknowledges Dr. Andrews' contributions while adhering to scholarly standards.

\*\*week 7: Should we be required to make our data public?

Pre-printing manuscripts on servers like bioRxiv and medRxiv has become increasingly popular in the scientific community. In the following, I will explain about some pros and cons:

Pros:

1- Pre-prints often generate early feedback from peers, in this way, the quality of the final manuscript will be improved.

2- By posting a pre-print, you can claim precedence for your work before it's peer-reviewed or published. It is significant for competitive fields.

3- Pre-prints can be cited by others, helping to the recognition of your work even before formal publication.

4- Sharing your work before journal publication allows the research community to access it more quickly, helping to accelerate scientific discovery.

Cons:

1- Sharing results openly before formal publication can expose the researchers’ work to the risk of being copied by others.

2- Pre-prints aren't peer-reviewed, as a result; they may contain errors or incomplete analyses. So, readers must exercise caution in interpreting them.

3- Some researchers may worry that sharing unreviewed work could harm their credibility, especially if important revisions are needed after peer review.

4- In my major (biomedical science) pre-prints may be misunderstood or misrepresented in the media, particularly if they contain preliminary findings.

I think the decision to pre-print depends on the nature of the research and the field. If rapid dissemination is critical and I feel confident in the robustness of my work, pre-printing could be an excellent strategy.

\*\*week 8: Explain how you would define an "ethical journal."

An "ethical journal" can be defined as a publication that adheres to a set of principles and practices aimed at maintaining integrity, transparency, and accountability in its content and operations. I believe they are some key features for it such as: 1. \*Peer Review Process\*: An ethical journal employs a rigorous and transparent peer review process to ensure the quality and credibility of the research it publishes. 2. \*Author Guidelines\*: It provides clear guidelines for authors regarding submission, ethics in research (such as plagiarism and conflicts of interest), and the expectations for data sharing and transparency. 3. \*Open Access and Accessibility\*: Ethical journals often promote open access to ensure that research is widely available and accessible to diverse audiences. 4. \*Conflict of Interest Disclosure\*: They require authors, reviewers, and editors to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that could influence the research or its interpretation. 5. \*\*Respect for Participants\*\*: Journals uphold ethical standards regarding the treatment of human and animal subjects, ensuring that research complies with ethical guidelines. 6. \*\*Data Integrity\*\*: Ethical journals expect authors to report their findings honestly and accurately, avoiding fabrication, falsification, or manipulation of data. 7. \*\*Responsiveness to Ethical Concerns\*\*: They have mechanisms in place for addressing ethical concerns or complaints about published work, including retractions when necessary. 8. \*\*Diversity and Inclusivity\*\*: An ethical journal values diverse perspectives and promotes inclusivity in its editorial board, authorship, and published content.

\*\*week 9:

"That’s actually a really common question! Indeed, statistics can sometimes be used or misinterpreted to support different ideas, but in research, we have strict standards to prevent that. When I did my analysis, I wasn’t just looking for a ‘significant’ P-value or some magic number that means my work was done. The real value of my analysis comes from careful planning, using the right methods for my data, and making sure my conclusions are solid and meaningful. Statistical significance (like a P-value) just gives a hint about whether the effect I observed is likely not due to chance, but there’s a whole lot of deeper work behind it that ensures I’m not just making numbers look good.

It’s kind of like a chef who uses a thermometer to know when food is cooked; the thermometer gives one piece of information, but you still need to combine it with good ingredients, technique, and experience to make a great dish. So, yes, statistics are one tool, but they’re only one piece of the work I’ve done."

\*\*Week 10:

Project title: "Crowdsourced Health Data for Disease Monitoring and Biomarker Discovery" 

Project overview: By gathering health data from a wide range of people, this citizen science project seeks to expedite scientific research. To find biomarkers for chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders, the data would be used to determine trends in disease progression, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions. Over time, participants will monitor their health measures, providing important information to enhance comprehension of the etiology of diseases and the variety of therapy responses. 

Project Objectives: 

1-**Identify Early Biomarkers:** Collect longitudinal health data to identify potential early biomarkers for diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and heart disease. 

2-**Understand Disease Progression:** Study how diseases develop over time in different populations, identifying potential environmental or lifestyle triggers. 

3-**Improve Treatment Personalization:** Help uncover genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that influence how individuals respond to treatments. 

4-**Enhance Public Health Models:** Use aggregated data to refine predictive models of disease and improve public health strategies. 

**Data Participants Would Collect** 

-   **Health Metrics:** Participants would self-monitor various health parameters such as blood pressure, blood glucose levels, heart rate, weight, sleep patterns, and physical activity. These metrics could be collected using wearables like fitness trackers, smartwatches, or other health apps.
