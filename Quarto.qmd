Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

![As a future scientist, I know I'll face many challenges;thus, I decided to take this class to broaden my horizon and be able to manage those challenges in future.](images/clipboard-1555617983.png) First, describe what you consider to be one of the most ground-breaking or "disruptive" papers in your field. Next, describe the most ground-breaking or disruptive paper in your field in the past 5-10 years. Do you believe the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in your field has declined in recent years? Why or why not?

In my point of view “Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid” by James Watson and Francis Crick, published in Nature in 1953 is one the most disruptive papers in biomedical science. The discovery of DNA's double helix structure, which drastically altered our knowledge of genetics, inheritance, and the molecular processes underpinning life itself, made this work groundbreaking. This discovery made modern molecular biology and biotechnology possible, opening the door to innovations in genetic engineering, DNA sequencing, and customized medicine. it had a significant impact on science and is frequently cited as one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the 20th century. The publication “A Programmable Dual-RNA-Guided DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity” by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna is one of the most groundbreaking papers in biomedical science in the past 5-10 years. In this paper, they introduced the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the first time which is an amazing tool for genome editing. CRISPR-Cas9 is an easy and cheap method to target special genes. In addition, it has been used across different fields. For instance, in disease research, it can model genetic disorders in animals and humans; also, in agriculture, they use it to produce more resilient crops. Furthermore, it accelerates research projects, so, the experiments that took a long time to be done can be done in a few months instead.

I believe that the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in biomedical science has declined in recent years due to the following reasons: 1- Nowadays, fields like genomic and synthetic biology are growing more complex, so, paradigm-shifting discoveries need interdisciplinary cooperation and cutting-edge tools. These tools are distributed among research labs widely. 2- Much of what has been discovered recently is based on fundamental discoveries made in previous decades, like the structure of DNA and the creation of CRISPR. Gradual improvements in current technologies frequently lead to dramatic advances as science becomes more complicated. For instance, whereas CRISPR had a significant early impact, more recent developments—like base editing and prime editing—are building upon and improving upon that ground-breaking discovery. 3- Basic science used to have a lot of breakthroughs (e.g., Watson and Crick's DNA structure). More paradigm-shifting work is now being done in applied science and translational medicine, where studies are directly influencing clinical therapies like COVID-19 vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and big data and AI-driven customized medicine. Although the real-world impact of these innovations is enormous, they may not feel as profoundly disruptive as the discovery of DNA's structure. 4- The pursuit and use of disruptive research are also influenced by social and ethical considerations. Certain technologies, such as CRISPR, are being used more slowly in some areas because they have raised significant ethical questions. This may slow down how quickly and obviously disruptive the insights emerge, without reducing their groundbreaking status.

**Reflect on the role of scientific computing in your discipline, particularly the use of programs, apps, and web-based tools for data analysis, management, data visualization, and communicating complex information to a broader audience. What challenges do you encounter when using these tools? Are there specific computing tools or techniques you currently use or plan to incorporate into your research?**

In my major, which is biomedical science, for managing large-scale data, such as genomic sequences, clinical data, or imaging study findings, programs, apps, and web-based solutions are essential. In the following, each factor will be clarified separately:

1- Data Analysis: In order to find trends, variations, or connections with disease, scientists can analyze large, complicated data sets using tools like R, Python, and specialist software like Bioconductor and MATLAB. Large, diverse datasets are increasingly being used to extract insights using machine learning and statistical models.

2- Data Management: Data must be properly organized, especially regarding sensitive patient information. Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and cloud-based data storage are two examples of platforms that assist researchers in managing massive datasets while adhering to privacy regulations like HIPAA. Maintaining reproducibility in data requires careful annotation, easy accessibility, and secure storage.

3- Data Visualization: Complex biological data communication to larger audiences frequently calls for sophisticated visualization methods. Researchers can construct easily understood graphs with tools like GraphPad Prism, ggplot2 in R, or bespoke Python libraries like Matplotlib. It can be difficult yet essential for discovery to integrate multi-dimensional data (e.g., integrating clinical, molecular, and imaging data) into a single visualization.

4- Communication of complex data: Research findings can be interactively presented using web-based platforms (like Shiny in R) and visualization tools, enabling non-specialists to examine the data. Dashboards, for instance, can make real-time developing clinical trial data accessible to stakeholders and clinicians. Making user-friendly interfaces without oversimplifying scientific material is a challenge.

Here are some examples of the challenges that students in my major might face using these tools:

1- Specialized coding or statistical analysis knowledge is needed to use many bioinformatics tools. For biologists who have little experience with computers, learning R, Python, or even proprietary platforms might be intimidating.

2-Reproducibility: It can be difficult to manage enormous datasets and guarantee transparent, repeatable computational procedures, particularly when varying software versions or algorithms may produce somewhat varied outcomes.

3-Data Integration: Biomedical data is generated from multiple sources (e.g., imaging, genomics, clinical trials), and the technical integration of these different data types is challenging.

Currently, one of the most important tools I am utilizing is GraphPad Prism. It is a very helpful tool for those who do standard statistical tests (such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression). Also, producing suitable graphs for publication is another advantage of it.

One of the other programs I am planning to learn is Python. One of the most important uses of this program is for bioinformatics to sequence analysis and perform genome mapping.

In my point of view, handling conflicting or disagreeable reviewer feedback on a manuscript requires a balance of professionalism, critical thinking, and strategic communication. My initial course of action when I hear feedback I disagree with is to thoroughly study the reviewer's point of view and evaluate their concerns. It's critical to maintain an open mind because reviewers frequently possess insightful knowledge and can point out areas that need improvement. I might have overlooked it. If after thoughtful consideration I still disagree, I make sure my response is respectful and supported by evidence. I clearly explain why I believe my original approach is valid, referencing relevant literature or data where appropriate. This makes it clearer that scientific logic, not taste, is the basis for all of my decisions.

When I receive comments that differ from that of another reviewer, I approach the situation with a similar mindset. Initially, I examine both viewpoints to see if there is a synthesis or compromise that could allay the reviewers' concerns. If the feedback is irreconcilable, I make an informed decision on which feedback aligns better with my research goals and the integrity of the manuscript. I expressly note the inconsistency in my response letter and provide a clear justification for my choice, stating why I chose to heed one proposal over the other. By maintaining transparency and using evidence-based reasoning, I aim to show that I took all feedback seriously, while still defending the rigor and direction of my work.
